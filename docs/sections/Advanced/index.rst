Overview of Customization Options
---------------------------------

- **Custom Score Functions**: Define custom scoring metrics tailored to your specific objectives. This flexibility allows you to optimize models based on metrics beyond standard evaluation scores, aligning with unique project requirements.

- **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent results by setting seeds and managing randomization across optimization runs. Reproducibility is essential for benchmarking and validating models in research and production environments.

- **Parallel Processing**: Accelerate optimization by distributing computations across multiple cores. Parallel processing can significantly reduce runtime, especially for complex models or extensive hyperparameter spaces.

Each section provides detailed guidance on implementing these advanced options.
