Virtual environment
-------------------

We recommend creating a virtual environment using Python's built-in ``venv`` package. To learn more, check the official
Python documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html.

Use the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

   # Create the virtual environment
   python -m venv myenv
   # Activate the virtual environment
   source myenv/bin/activate

Once the environment is activated, install ``mloptimizer`` by running:

.. code:: bash

   pip install mloptimizer
