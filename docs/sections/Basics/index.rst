Basics
==================

The BaseOptimizer is an abstract base class that provides
the fundamental structure for all optimizers in the mloptimizer package.
It is designed to optimize a classifier using a genetic algorithm.
The class includes methods for setting up the optimization process,
defining the hyperparameters to be optimized, and running the optimization.

The BaseOptimizer class is designed to be subclassed.
MLOptimizer provides several subclasses of the BaseOptimizer class.
